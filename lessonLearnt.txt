pip install django
create a django project by typing :  django-admin startproject "name of project without '' . "  FOR EXAMPLE django-admin startproject django_todo .

To expose the django project, u type in cmd terminal : python manage.py runserver

URLS:
type in cmd:
              django-admin startapp todo

in the urls.py file > urlpatterns = [(regularexpression)r'^name of app$', name of function in the views.py file]

ADMIN: in command enter:
1:  sqlite3 dbsqlite3
2:  python manage.py migrate (we can run our migrations)
3: .tables
4: .quit
5: select * from django_migrations;
6:.header on then select * from django_migrations
7:.mode column then select * from django_migrations

8:python manage.py createsuperuser
9:sqlite3 db.sqlite3/.tables/select * from auth_user;/.mode column/.headers on/select * from auth_user;
line 9 will give a more readable environment to a table

Lessons learnt for sqlite table. (to make the table more readable do the following):

1:  sqlite3 dbsqlite3
2:  .tables
3:  select * from django_migrations;
4:  .headers on
5:  .mode column
6:  select * from django_migrations;

MODELS

1:  python manage.py makemigrations (this cmd will make a file > create a new table in our database called todo_items)
2:  sqlite3 dbsqlite3
3:  .tables

pip install coverage: how much of our code we have run/tested

coverage cmd keys:
1:  coverage run manage.py test
2:  coverage report (but it does a test report on all of the python packages)
3: for a specific directory i.e. todo i will input : coverage run --source=todo manage.py test

if i do a test, i.e. in models.py file as when u conduct a test (coverage report) and its got 68% we need 100% testing results so when we do a test we then get the report up to see if its been updated, i.e. in cmd: coverage report

IMPORTANT: for updates to coverage report (if u have "missing" in one of the files(this means u need testing whatever is indicated in red) once u do a test in one of the test.py files TO SEE the new coverage (updated coverage) in the cmd terminal u need to type

1  coverage run --source=todo manage.py test
2: coverage html then reload the page)
